      <h3>About page</h3>
      <p>
        Hello there! I'm Aster Paredes Morales; I was born and raised in the Philippines 
        and now residing in Inglewood, California. I am a Brigham Young University-Idaho(Online) 
        student pursuing a Bachelor's in Software Development. As a passionate learner, 
        I am committed to mastering the art of building functional, visually appealing, 
        and user-friendly websites. I am learning HTML and CSS to know the foundational 
        tools to allow me to bring ideas to life and transform them into seamless online 
        experiences. 

        As a student, I embrace continuous learning and seek opportunities to stay ahead 
        of industry trends. My personal website portfolio serves as a reflection of my 
        commitment to self-improvement and growth. I am dedicated to refining my problem-solving 
        abilities and staying up-to-date. I can ensure my skills remain relevant in an ever-evolving 
        digital landscape by embracing lifelong learning.

        Collaboration is an essential aspect of my journey as a student. I am eager to work with designers, 
        fellow developers, and mentors to create dynamic and engaging websites. By combining our unique 
        perspectives and expertise, we can foster an innovative environment and develop digital solutions 
        that have a lasting impact. 

        In addition to technical skills, I bring a strong work ethic and attention to detail. 
        I can embrace new challenges and deliver high-quality results. My goal is to build 
        functional websites and ensure they are accessible, optimized for performance, 
        and meet the specific needs of the users. 

        I am eager to contribute my skills and passion to real-world projects. 
        I look forward to collaborating with industry professionals, agencies, 
        and organizations to create meaningful online experiences that inspire, 
        inform, and engage users.  

        I love to cook, bake, and crochet and enjoy watching anime. 
        Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. 
        I am excited about the possibilities and look forward to 
        connecting with fellow developers to explore how we can work 
        together to shape the future of the web.
